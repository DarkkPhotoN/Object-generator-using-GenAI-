# Sky-Rim

Input for the Project

1. Cold Drink to refresh in summer. Budget friendly and easily accessible. Tastes in different flavours and comes in a tin can .

2. Entity which I can use to travel through black hole without getting affecting by the strange forces around the black hole. The entity must travel more than speed of light and should withstand any type of strong forces present in space.
